          UX/UI certification from BrainStation, I've worked closely with design
          teams, sharpening my eye for user-centric design principles.
          Transitioning from development to product design, I bring strong
          technical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (especially React),
          bridging the gap between design and development effortlessly. I'm
          adept at engaging in productive conversations with various teams,
          thanks to my innate empathy. Additionally, I'm proficient in AI tools
          like Chat GPT and GitHub Co-Pilot, enhancing my efficiency and
          innovation in design.`;

export const caseStudyCopy = `In my product design portfolio, I've embarked on two impactful
          projects. The first project, "Property Pal," is an app designed to
          simplify multi-home property management, specifically catering to
          elderly property owners. It prioritizes user-friendliness and
          affordability, significantly improving their property management
          experience. In the second project, I led a comprehensive redesign of
          JetBlue's trip booking feature, focusing on enhancing
          user-friendliness and efficiency. This overhaul exemplifies my
          commitment to user-centric design, ultimately elevating the usability
          and satisfaction of travelers when planning their journeys.`;
