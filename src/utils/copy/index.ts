Collaborating closely with design teams, I've developed a keen eye for user-centric design principles. As a frontend developer and designer, I bring strong technical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (especially React), seamlessly bridging the gap between design and development. Thanks to my innate empathy, I excel in productive discussions with cross-functional teams. Additionally, I'm proficient in AI tools like Chat GPT and GitHub Co-Pilot, enhancing my efficiency and innovation in design.

export const caseStudyCopy = `In my product design portfolio, I've embarked on two impactful
          projects. The first project, "Property Pal," is an app designed to
          simplify multi-home property management, specifically catering to
          elderly property owners. It prioritizes user-friendliness and
          affordability, significantly improving their property management
          experience. In the second project, I led a comprehensive redesign of
          JetBlue's trip booking feature, focusing on enhancing
          user-friendliness and efficiency. This overhaul exemplifies my
          commitment to user-centric design, ultimately elevating the usability
          and satisfaction of travelers when planning their journeys.`;
